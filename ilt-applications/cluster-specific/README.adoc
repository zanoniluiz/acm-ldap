This folder holds applications that need per-cluster configuration.

Cluster specific (and that means ONLY deploying to a particular cluster, not a set of clusters with a
common label) go into the application-name-x directories with kustomizations per cluster.

This can include the hub cluster for applications that only go to the hub cluster.

The directory structure should be like this:

.
├── application-name-1
│   └── hub
├── application-name-2
│   ├── base
│   └── overlays
│       ├── cluster-name-1
│       ├── cluster-name-2
│       └── ...
└── application-name-3
    ├── base
    └── overlays
        ├── cluster-name-1
        ├── cluster-name-2
        └── ...
